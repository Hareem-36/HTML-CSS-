    <center><h3><u>Khatam-e-Nabuwat (Finality of Prophethood)</u></h3></center><br>
    <p><b>The concept of <strong>Khatam-e-Nabuwat</strong> (Finality of Prophethood) is central to Islamic belief, affirming that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the last prophet. Here are key points about this doctrine:</b></p>
    <br><ul>
        <li><strong>Qur'anic Reference:</strong> The verse in Surah Al-Ahzab (33:40) explicitly states that Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is the "Seal of the Prophets," marking the end of prophethood.</li>
        <li><strong>Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) Role:</strong> As the final messenger, his teachings, the Quran, and Sunnah serve as complete guidance for all of humanity.</li>
        <li><strong>No New Prophets:</strong> After the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), no new prophet will come. This is a fundamental belief for Muslims.</li>
        <li><strong>Unanimous Belief:</strong> The belief in the finality of prophethood is unanimously held by all major Islamic sects and scholars throughout history.</li>
        <li><strong>Historical Defense:</strong> Muslims have historically defended this belief, especially against any false claimants of prophethood after the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritual Completeness:</strong> Islam, as delivered by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), is considered a complete and perfected religion that needs no further messengers.</li>
        <li><strong>Ahadith on Finality:</strong> Numerous hadiths confirm Prophet Muhammad's (PBUH) role as the last prophet, warning against false claimants.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Framework:</strong> Several Islamic countries, including Pakistan, have legal provisions to protect the belief in Khatam-e-Nabuwat.</li>
        <li><strong>Spiritual and Moral Guidance:</strong> Muslims believe that the Quran and Sunnah provide comprehensive guidance for all aspects of life, without the need for new revelations.</li>
        <li><strong>Unity in Ummah:</strong> The belief in Khatam-e-Nabuwat is a point of unity for Muslims, reinforcing the shared adherence to the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).</li>

    <h1 class="my-heading"><u>Mohammed’s ﷺ Character reflected in his teachings</u></h1> 
    <p class="lead-para"> 
      <div class="post-excerpt"><p>Amr bin Absar (May Allah be pleased with him)&nbsp; was the stepbrother of&nbsp; Abu Dhar Ghifari (May Allah be pleased with him). He was a shepherd. Even during his days of ignorance, he did not consume alcohol or worship idols. He used to say, &ldquo;Because I used to abstain from these two sins, Allah blessed me. During the scorching heat of summer,&nbsp; there used to be a piece of cloud over my head wherever I went in the desert. It was a shade provided by Allah.&rdquo; He continued, &ldquo;One day I came to know from people that something strange has happened in Makkah. A man from amongst them has declared himself to be the Messenger of Allah and is trying to stop them from worshipping idols and killing of daughters.</p>

        <p>I went to Makkah and made enquiries about him. After meeting him, I embraced Islam and was probably the third or fourth Muslim at that time. It was the earliest period of Islam.</p>
        
        <p>I asked him, &ldquo;What is Islam?&rdquo;&nbsp; He replied, &ldquo;Talking to people courteously and feeding the hungry.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>I asked him, &ldquo;What is Emaan?&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;As-sabru was-samaha; Being patient and being tolerant (towards others).&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;I asked again, &ldquo; Which is the best deed in Islam?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;To let people be safe from your tongue and hand.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;I asked, &ldquo;Which is the best part of Emaan?&rdquo; He replied &ldquo;To develop good conduct in one&rsquo;s self.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>I asked again, &ldquo;Which is the best prayer?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;The one which has a long qiyam (standing).&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;I asked, &ldquo; Which is the best Hijrat?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;One where a person abstains from deeds which displease Allah.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>&nbsp;I asked again, &ldquo; Whose Jihad is the best?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo; One who goes to fight in the way of Allah and gets killed.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>I asked again, &ldquo;Which is the best time to make dua?&rdquo; He replied, &ldquo;The last part of the night.&rdquo;</p>
        
        <p>The above hadith records that the earliest commands of Islam were mostly related to character building.&nbsp;</p>
        
        <ol>
          <p>Talking politely and respectfully to others is a form of Islam.</p>
          <p>&nbsp;Sabr and Samaha &ndash; Being patient and tolerant towards others, and forgiving them for their mistakes is a part of Emaan.</p>
          <p>Abstaining from harming others, physically or verbally, is a part of&nbsp; good conduct.</p>
        </ol>
        
        <p>This is how Islam began training mankind to perfect the character, right from day one.&nbsp;</p>
